# The Problem

## Evaluation of ENV variables

```typescript
const foo = process.env.foo;
// or
const { foo } = process.env;
```

## Runtime?

Functions only fail when they call a missing env var

## Compile-time or dev-time?

## Someone once asked me what I'm doing for the environment.

## A lot. Even the bags under my eyes are reusable.
