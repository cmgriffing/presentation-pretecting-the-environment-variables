# What

## Syntax Trees

- **concrete syntax trees**: structures that represent every detail (such as white-space in white-space insensitive languages)
- **abstract syntax trees**: structures that only represent details relating to the syntactic structure of code (such as ignoring whether a double or single quote was used in languages that support both, such as JavaScript).
